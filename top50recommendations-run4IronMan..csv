Just a brilliant, clean movie. I am a 17 year old guy and this movie still wrenched my heart till the very end. The animation is the best there is so far, and while the the love part of the plot was a tad cheesy...it was necessary and great. The movie is so convincing that earth will become of what is portrayed that it scared me the night after I watched it, thinking \""this is might actually happen in 750 years.\"" Doubt any other movie will top this in 2008."" ]";0.0;0.0;;;inf;10

It's bleak and haunting, but brings out that ultimate human spirit of survival which was so moving in the novel. I can't figure out why there are so many mixed reviews and why the Weinsteins sandbagged this film with absolutely no marketing whatsoever.

Too bad the choreography is atypical contemporary Hollywood action movie, with quick cuts that make it impossible to truly absorb yourself in the detailed world of Pandora. You want to see a true visual masterpiece? Watch 2001 or Blade Runner, on Blu-Ray. Avatar has nothing on those two movies, and I wasn't even close to being born when they were released in theaters. Ironic how Cameron's best movie is still the gritty low-budget masterpiece The Terminator, made on a measly 6 mil."" ]";0.0;0.0;;;inf;6

chelsea-walls;2;PJ;;Jun 30, 2006;"[ ""I don't understand the series of 10's this film earned in the user ratings. If a film like Citizen Kane represents a generally accepted level of supreme fillmmaking, and therefore worthy of a 10, Chelsea Walls is nowhere near that mark. In addition, the notion that anyone giving this film a poor review, is either not very bright or didn't view the film with an open mind, is rather immature. This film was recommended to me by a friend, with whom I share a similar taste in film. So, I went into this expecting to like the Chelsea Walls...but that's not how it turned out. First off, the grainy digital picture and lifeless camerawork make the visuals an absolute chore to take in. The dim interior and exterior lighting doesn't help matters any. As far as the actual performances go, there were a few actors that turned in intermittently compelling performances. However, the amount of time devoted to most of the characters is brief which doesn't allow for much development. Not only were the individual story arcs quite thin, they also failed to interweave in a manner that added anything of value to the plot line. In general, everything about this film seemed very contrived and amateurish. It plays more like a documentary than an ensemble drama. Had this been a documentary chronicling the lives of actual Chelsea residents, I would've been more receptive, and been able to take the characters seriously. Yet, it's a fictional tale of struggling artists pretentiously portrayed by established actors in somber settings. The most pressing question this film raises, is just what the filmmakers were trying to express about the Chelsea and its residents. Apparently, what was once a grand hotel that housed some of histories greatest American artists, is now nothing more than a run-down haven for aimless deadbeats who's personal problems will prevent them from ever making great art. That seemed to be the sentiment of the two cops in the film, and is what makes them, sadly, the only two characters I could really identify with. If I had to describe this film in one word, that word would be \""bleak.\"""" ]";0.0;0.0;;;inf;2
