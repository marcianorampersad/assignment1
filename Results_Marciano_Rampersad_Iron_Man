The movie I picked was Iron Man., my favorite movie I selected in the introduction week is Avengers End Game,
but this movie is not in the list because it is quite new. So I replaced that movie with the movie that started 
the Marvel universe, Iron Man. 

The first run was based on the summary of the movie Iron Man. The output showed 50 movies when the rank was 0.1 
(this was my starting rank, so there was no need to make it smaller). The movies that are highly ranked in the 
output are all futuristic or hero movies. This makes a lot of sense, and a lot of the recommended movies are also 
movies I enjoyed (the other Iron Mans, Thor, Tron Legacy, and more). The number 4 on this list (The Losers) is a 
movie I did not see yet, but when I look at the description it looks like a movie I would enjoy. The system works 
well when the summary is used to recommend other movies. 

In the second run I used the title instead of the summary to recommend movies. The output did not show any movies 
when the rank was 0.1 so I changed it to 0.0001 to see if there would be a recommendation, and there where 5 
eventually. Because I used the words Iron and Man, the only moves that matched where the movies with those words 
in the name. This method is less useful in my opinion, because the name of a movie does not have to be very descriptive.
 The word Iron and Man do not say a lot about the story of the movie, and the words can be used in a lot of different 
ways. Therefore I would say the summary method of run 1 is better in this case. 

The third and final run was focused on the starring actors in the movie. I picked the main man Robert Downey Jr to focus 
on and to see if I got useful recommendations. The output generated 40 movies (when I changed the rank 0.1 to the 0.0001) 
with a lot of movies in the upper part with Robert Downey Jr as an actor, but there are also some movies without him in 
the cast. They are lower ranked, but they also look like interesting movies to me (for example Man of Honor). 

In the end I think that summary is the best way to create recommendations, starring comes second and title is 
the worst way out of the 3 different methods. It would be interesting to improve this system for example by combining 
the summary and the starring runs to generate a more specific recommendation. There where a lot more recommendations than 
I expected in the beginning, especially for the third run. The second run was a bit disappointing but I exacted that 
already, I could make the keyword “man” and probably get a lot of output, but then it is not really relevant in my opinion.
